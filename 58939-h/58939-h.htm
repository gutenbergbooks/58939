<p>Recently the dolphin has become the focus of
much scientific interest and investigation which have led to
flattering pronouncements about its remarkable intelligence,
amiability, and astonishing friendliness towards man. It was in
consequence of such activities that a symposium was held at the
William Andrews Clark Memorial Library to consider the background
to contemporary studies of the dolphin. The presentations
of Dr. Ashley Montagu and Dr. John C. Lilly were received
so favorably that it was decided to make them more
widely available in the present form.</p>
<p>As will be readily apparent to any reader, Dr. Montagu has
demonstrated conclusively that had the writings of the ancients
been heeded we should long since have paid proper respect to
this intelligent mammal, and Dr. Lilly has reinforced such
classical appreciation by an account of his own astonishing observations
of dolphin behavior. It is to be hoped that these two
accounts will contribute to a lasting appreciation of our remarkable
aquatic friend.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>I have met with a story, which, although authenticated

<span class="lr"><i>Pliny the Younger</i></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The history of the dolphin is one of the most fascinating
and instructive in the historiography and the history of
ideas in the western world. Indeed, it provides one of the most
illuminating examples of what has probably occurred many
times in human culture&mdash;a virtually complete loss of knowledge,
at least in most segments of the culture, of what was formerly
well understood by generations of men. &ldquo;Not in entire forgetfulness&rdquo;
in some regions of the world, but certainly in &ldquo;a sleep
and a forgetting&rdquo; in the most sophisticated centers of the western
world.</p>
<p>Dolphins are mammals. They belong in the order Cetacea,
suborder Odontoceti, family Delphinidae. Within the Delphinidae
there are some twenty-two genera and about fifty-five
species. The count includes the Killer Whale, the False Killer
Whale, the White Whale, and the Pilot Whale, all of which are
true dolphins. There are two subfamilies, the Delphinapterinae,
consisting of the two genera <i>Monodon monocerus</i>, the Narwhal,
and <i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>, the White Whale or Beluga. These
two genera are distinguished by the fact that none of the neck
vertebrae are fused, whereas in all remaining genera, embraced
in the subfamily Delphininae, at least the first and second neck
vertebrae are fused.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>It was Aristotle in his <i>History of Animals</i> (521b) who first
classified whales, porpoises, and dolphins as Cetacea,
<span title="ta k&ecirc;t&ecirc; oion delphis kai ph&ocirc;kaina kai phalaina">&tau;&#8048; &kappa;&#8053;&tau;&eta; &omicron;&#8150;&omicron;&nu; &delta;&epsilon;&lambda;&phi;&iota;&sigmaf; &kappa;&alpha;&#8054; &phi;&omega;&kappa;&alpha;&#8054;&nu;&alpha; &kappa;&alpha;&#8054; &phi;&#8049;&lambda;&alpha;&iota;&nu;&alpha;</span>.
Aristotle&rsquo;s account of the
Cetacea was astonishingly accurately written, and quite evidently
from firsthand knowledge of these animals.</p>
<p>While most dolphins are inhabitants of the seas, there are
some that live in rivers, and quite a few that are denizens of
fresh-water rivers removed many miles from the sea. With one
exception the diet of dolphins is principally fish. The one exception
is <i>Sotalia teuszii</i>, which lives in the Kamerun River, and is
believed to feed exclusively on vegetable matter. The Ting Ling
dolphin (<i>Lipotes vexillifer</i>) lives in Ting Ling Lake, six hundred
miles up the Yang-tse-Kiang. Another dolphin, the Susu
or Ganges dolphin (<i>Platanista gangetica</i>) of Brahmapootra, the
Ganges, and the Indus, has lenseless eyes and is almost blind.
The fresh-water dolphins belong in the family Platanistidae.</p>
<p>It is of interest to note that, in connection with the vegetable
feeding habits of the Kamerun dolphin, Lycophron, in his <i>Alexandra</i>,
makes his dolphins feed on trees, and Ovid, in the <i>Metamorphoses</i>
(III, 1, 202), describes a flood in which the dolphins
take possession of the woods. Nonnus Panopolitanus, in the
<i>Dionysiaca</i> (VI, 265-266), also describes dolphins as feeding on
trees.</p>
<p>The normal range of length of dolphins is from 5 to 14 feet;
the larger species, the whales, are considerably longer. Brain
weight is between 1600 and 1700 grams in the familiar dolphins,
and reaches 9200 grams and more in the whales. The large brain
is associated with what, all observers familiar with these animals
agree, is a quite considerable intelligence.</p>
<p>Here we must pause to make a plea for the proper usage of
common names. The term &ldquo;porpoise&rdquo; refers to the small, beakless
Delphinidae, which have a triangular dorsal fin and spade-shaped
teeth. The name &ldquo;dolphin&rdquo; embraces all other members
of the family, except the larger forms, which are called whales.
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
The porpoises mostly belong in the genus <i>Phocaena</i>, the best
known species of which, the Common Porpoise (<i>Phocaena phocaena</i>),
never reaches a length exceeding 6 feet and weighs 100
to 120 pounds. There are some six species. The finless black porpoise
constitutes the only other genus with a single species
<i>Neomeris phocaenoides</i>.</p>
<p>All porpoises are dolphins. The Bottle-Nosed Dolphin, <i>Tursiops
truncatus</i>, is sometimes called a porpoise. This is incorrect.
<i>Tursiops</i> is a true dolphin, and should not be called what it is not.</p>
<p>Here we shall be principally concerned with the Bottle-Nosed
Dolphin and with the Common Dolphin. The Bottle-Nosed
Dolphin has a short, well-defined snout two or three inches long,
and is characterized by a prominent fin in the middle of the
back. Coloration is dark above and light below. Gestation lasts
some ten months, birth is monotocous, and the young are
suckled for about 18 months. The tail is delivered first, and the
infant, about three feet long and weighing about twenty-five
pounds, is immediately quite active, though much in need of the
care of its devoted mother. The infant will eventually grow to be
between 11 and 12 feet in length, and weigh about 300 kilograms.
<i>Tursiops</i> has an enormously wide range, being commonest
along the Atlantic coast of America, from Maine to Florida,
and occurs in the Bay of Biscay, in the Mediterranean Sea, and as
far south as New Zealand.</p>
<p>The Common Dolphin, <i>Delphinus delphis</i>, is readily recognized
by its well-defined narrow beak and distinctive coloration.
The beak is some 5 to 6 inches narrower and finer than in the
Bottle-Nosed Dolphin, and is sharply marked off by a deep V-shaped
groove from the low reclining forehead. The Common
Dolphin reaches a length up to 8&frac12; feet. Its range of distribution
is very wide, for it may be met in any temperate or warm sea
throughout the world, and occurs at times in vast schools.</p>
<p>Whether the dolphin of classical antiquity is <i>Delphinus</i> or
<i>Tursiops</i> is not usually determinable, although each undoubtedly
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
played its independent role in the stories told of dolphins.
From the recorded evidence available to us it is clear
that, except for the larger species, the whales, all dolphins appear
to be characterized by playfulness and friendliness toward
man. There are, however, differences which appear to express
themselves mostly in captivity. At least, <i>Tursiops</i> adjusts much
better to captivity than does <i>Delphinus</i>. At marine studios
<i>Tursiops</i> has established itself as a highly intelligent, playful,
and friendly performer. <i>Delphinus</i>, on the other hand, while
naturally all these things, in captivity tends to be timid and not
very playful.</p>
<p>The Common and Bottle-Nosed Dolphins are those best
known to the western world, but many of the traits which have
recently been rediscovered concerning these creatures have been
well known to other peoples for millennia. It is only a certain
segment of the western world, its more sophisticated representation,
and particularly the learned world, which dismissed as
myths the tales told about dolphins in classical antiquity. And
this is the real burden of the story I have to tell you. Some of
these antique tales may have been myths, but as we shall see,
many of them were not, and undoubtedly a number of the
myths were based on real events partially embroidered by the
imagination and improved, like good wine, by time. But good
wine needs no bush, and I shall sample this wine as palatably
as I find it.</p>
<p>The earliest representation of a dolphin I have been able to
find is from a pictographic seal from Crete, estimated to date
from 3500 to 2200 B.C. The earliest <i>painting</i> of a dolphin thus
far recovered is from the ancient Peloponnesian city of Tiryns.
The date is about 1600 B.C. In that city it is also represented
in stucco floors. Several good examples of dolphins are furnished
by seventh century Corinthian art. The dolphin is also well represented
in Minoan art. In Cyprus it is frequently represented
in Late Helladic vases, shards, amphorae, in metalwork, engravings,
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
and in stucco floors as at Tiryns. Among the importations
from Crete into Helladic art appear to have been certain
stylized forms of the dolphin.</p>
<p>An early literary reference to the dolphin occurs in Aesop&rsquo;s
fable, &ldquo;The Monkey and the Dolphin.&rdquo; During a violent storm
a ship was capsized, and among those thrown into the water was
a monkey. Observing its distress a dolphin came to its rescue,
and taking the monkey upon its back the dolphin headed for
shore. Opposite Piraeus, the harbor of Athens, the dolphin inquired
of the monkey whether he was an Athenian. &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo;
replied the monkey, &ldquo;and from one of the best families.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then
you know Piraeus,&rdquo; said the dolphin. &ldquo;Very well, indeed,&rdquo; said
the monkey, &ldquo;he is one of my most intimate friends.&rdquo; Whereupon,
outraged by so gross a deceit, the dolphin took a deep dive
and left the monkey to its fate.</p>
<p>I take it that ever since that day monkeys have very sensibly
refrained from speech. It is far better to remain silent even at
the risk of being taken for a fool or a rogue, than to open one&rsquo;s
mouth and remove all doubt.</p>
<p>Aesop flourished about 600 B.C. His story suggests a considerable
knowledge of the ways of dolphins, and this indicates
that knowledge of the dolphin was already old in his time.</p>
<p>There are several variant Greek myths on the origin of the
dolphin. All of them relate to Dionysos. In one version Dionysos
is an adult, in another he is a child. The first group of legends
represent the epiphany of Dionysos, symbolizing the battle between
winter and summer. Winter is represented by the death
of Dionysos who disappears into the water, from which he is
brought back on the top of a dolphin as the returning springtime
(Apollodorus, III, 5, 3). Another version has Dionysos, whether
as child or adult varies, being conveyed by ship to Naxos by
Tyrrhenian mariners. The latter conceive the idea of kidnaping
him. Dionysos senses their treachery, and bidding his companions
strike up on their musical instruments, he produces a
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
Bacchic wild dance in the mariners who throw themselves overboard
and are changed into dolphins.</p>
<p>The popular belief in antiquity in the human intelligence of
dolphins and their kindly feeling toward man was explained
by the ancient writers in the light of the transformation of the
Tyrrhenian pirates into dolphins. (See Lucian, <i>Marine Dialogues</i>,
8; Oppian, <i>Halieutica</i>, I, 649-654, 1098, V, 422, 519f;
Porphyry, <i>De Abstinentia</i>, III, 16.) As Oppian (I, 1089) in his
<i>Halieutica</i> has it, in William Diaper&rsquo;s charming translation:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">So <i>Dolphins</i> teem, whom subject Fish revere,</p>
<p class="t0">And show the smiling Seas their Infant-Heir.</p>
<p class="t">All other Kinds, whom Parent-Seas confine,</p>
<p class="t0"><i>Dolphins</i> excell; that Race is all divine.</p>
<p class="t0"><i>Dolphins</i> were Men (Tradition hands the Tale)</p>
<p class="t0">Laborious Swains bred on the <i>Tuscan</i> Vale:</p>

<p class="t0">Plung&rsquo;d in the Waves, and untry&rsquo;d Fins displayed,</p>
<p class="t0">No further Change relenting <i>Bacchus</i> wrought,</p>
<p class="t0">Nor have the <i>Dolphins</i> all the Man forgot;</p>
<p class="t0">The conscious Soul retains her former Thought.</p>
</div>
<p>The god of the golden trident who rules over the seas, Poseidon,
would not have prospered in his wooing of Amphitrite if
it had not been for the assistance of a dolphin, who apprized
Poseidon of her hiding-place. For this service, as is well-known,
Poseidon set the dolphin among the stars in the constellation
which bears its name to this day.</p>
<p>It is interesting in this connection that in a modern Greek folktale
from Zacynthos, Poseidon changes a hero who has fallen
into the sea into a dolphin until such time as he should find a
maiden ready to be his wife. After some time the dolphin rescues
a shipwrecked king and his daughter, the princess by way of
reward takes him for her husband, and the spell is broken (Bernhard
Schmidt, <i>Das Volksleben der Neugriechen</i>, p. 135).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>The cult of Apollo Delphinus was initiated, so legend has it,
by Icadius who, leaving his native land of Lycia, which he had
named for his mother, set out for Italy. Shipwrecked on the way,
he was taken on the back of a dolphin, which set him down near
Mount Parnassus, where he founded a temple to his father
Apollo, and called the place Delphi after the dolphin. For this
reason the dolphin became among the things most sacred to
Apollo (Servius, <i>Commentarii in Vergilii Aeneidos</i>, III, 332;
also Cornificius Longus, <i>De Etymis Deorum</i>).</p>
<p>Herodotos, writing of Periander (fl. 600 B.C.) tyrant of Corinth,
tells one of the most famous of all stories of the dolphin
(it is mentioned by Shakespeare in the first act of <i>Twelfth
Night</i>). &ldquo;In his time,&rdquo; writes Herodotos (b. 484 B.C.), &ldquo;a very
wonderful thing is said to have happened. The Corinthians and
the Lesbians agree in their account of the matter. They relate
that Arion of Methymna, who, as a player on the lyre, was second
to no man living at that time, and who was, so far as we
know, the first to invent the dithyrambic measure, to give it its
name, and to conduct in it at Corinth, was carried to Taenarum
on the back of a dolphin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had lived, it is said, at the court of Periander, when a
longing came upon him to sail across to Italy and Sicily. Having
made rich profits in those parts, he wanted to recross the seas
to Corinth. He therefore hired a vessel, the crew of which were
Corinthians, thinking that there was no people in whom he
could more safely confide; and, going on board, he set sail from
Tarentum. The sailors, however, when they reached the open
sea, formed a plot to throw him overboard and seize upon his
riches. Discovering their design, he fell on his knees, beseeching
them to spare his life, and making them welcome to his money.
But they refused; and required him either to kill himself outright,
if he wished for a grave on the dry land, or without loss
of time to leap overboard into the sea. In this strait Arion begged
them, since such was their pleasure, to allow him to mount upon
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
the quarter-deck, dressed in his full costume, and there to play
and sing, and promising that, as soon as his song was ended, he
would destroy himself. Delighted at the prospect of hearing the
very best singer in the world, they consented, and withdrew
from the stern to the middle of the vessel: while Arion dressed
himself in the full costume of his calling, took his lyre, and
standing on the quarter-deck, chanted the Orthian [a very high-pitched
lively and spirited song]. His strain ended, he flung
himself, fully attired as he was, headlong into the sea. The Corinthians
then sailed on to Corinth. As for Arion, a dolphin, they
say, took him upon his back and carried him to Taenarum,
where he went ashore, and thence proceeded to Corinth in his
musician&rsquo;s dress, and told all that had happened to him. Periander,
however, disbelieved the story, and put Arion in ward,
to prevent his leaving Corinth, while he watched anxiously for
the return of the mariners. On their arrival he summoned them
before him and asked them if they could give him any tidings of
Arion. They returned for answer that he was alive and in good
health in Italy, and that they had left him at Tarentum, where
he was doing well. Thereupon Arion appeared before them,
just as he was when he jumped from the vessel: the men, astonished
and detected in falsehood, could no longer deny their
guilt. Such is the account which the Corinthians and Lesbians
give; and there is to this day at Taenarum an offering of Arion&rsquo;s
at the shrine, which is a small figure in bronze, representing a
man seated upon a dolphin.&rdquo; (<i>The History of Herodotus</i>, Clio,
I, 23-24.)</p>
<p>Commenting on this tale the poet Bianor, in <i>The Greek Anthology</i>
(<i>Declamatory Epigrams</i>, 308), remarks, &ldquo;So the sea
presumably contains fish whose righteousness exceeds that of
mankind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Coins of Methymna, in Lesbos, Arion&rsquo;s birthplace, show him
riding a dolphin. In one form or another the dolphin is represented
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
on the coins of some forty Greek cities, and doubtless
most Greeks knew the reason why.</p>
<p>Pliny the Elder, in his <i>Natural History</i> (IX, 8, 24-28), writes
as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dolphin is an animal that is not only friendly to mankind
but is also a lover of music, and it can be charmed by singing
in harmony, but particularly by the sound of the water-organ.
It is not afraid of a human being as something strange
to it, but comes to meet vessels at sea and sports and gambols
round them, actually trying to race them and passing them even
when under full sail. In the reign of the late lamented Augustus
a dolphin that had been brought into the Lucrine Lake fell
marvellously in love with a certain boy, a poor man&rsquo;s son, who
used to go from the Baiae district to school at Pozzuoli, because
fairly often the lad when loitering about the place at noon called
him to him by the name of Snubnose and coaxed him with bits
of the bread he had with him for the journey,&mdash;I should be
ashamed to tell the story were it not that it has been written
about by Maecenas and Fabianus and Flavius Alfius and many
others,&mdash;and when the boy called to it at whatever time of day,
although it was concealed in hiding, it used to fly to him out of
the depth, eat out of his hand, and let him mount on its back,
sheathing as it were the prickles of its fin, and used to carry him
when mounted right across the bay to Pozzuoli to school, bringing
him back in similar manner, for several years, until the boy
died of disease, and then it used to keep coming sorrowfully
and like a mourner to the customary place, and itself also expired,
quite undoubtedly from longing. Another dolphin in
recent years at Hippo Diarrhytus on the coast of Africa similarly
used to feed out of people&rsquo;s hands and allow itself to be stroked,
and play with swimmers and carry them on its back. The Governor
of Africa, Flavianus, smeared it all over with perfume,
and the novelty of the scent apparently put it to sleep: it floated
lifelessly about, holding aloof from human intercourse for some
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
months as if it had been driven away by insult; but afterwards
it returned and was an object of wonder as before. The expense
caused to their hosts by persons of official position who came to
see it forced the people of Hippo to destroy it. Before these occurrences
a similar story is told about a boy in the city of Iasus,
with whom a dolphin was observed for a long time to be in love,
and while eagerly following him to the shore when he was going
away it grounded on the sand and expired; Alexander the Great
made the boy head of the priesthood of Poseidon at Babylon,
interpreting the dolphin&rsquo;s affection as a sign of the deity&rsquo;s favour.
Hegesidemus writes that in the same city of Iasus another boy
also, named Hermias, while riding across the sea in the same
manner lost his life in the waves of a sudden storm, but was
brought back to the shore, and the dolphin confessing itself the
cause of his death did not return out to sea and expired on dry
land. Theophrastus records that exactly the same thing occurred
at Naupactos too. Indeed there are unlimited instances: the people
of Amphilocus and Taranto tell the same stories about boys
and dolphins; and these make it credible that also the skilled
harper Arion, when at sea the sailors were getting ready to kill
him with the intention of stealing the money he had made, succeeded
in coaxing them to let him first play a turn on his harp,
and the music attracted a school of dolphins, whereupon he
dived into the sea and was taken up by one of them and carried
ashore at Cape Matapan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A very similar but apparently quite independent account of
these stories is given by the younger Pliny, in his <i>Letters</i> (IX,
23).</p>
<p>The elder Pliny then goes on to tell of the manner in which
dolphins assist fishermen, which corresponds closely with the accounts
given by recent observers of this cooperative activity between
fishermen and dolphins. (For accounts of these see
Antony Alpers, <i>Dolphins</i>, 146 sq.)</p>
<p>There are numerous other stories similar to those given by the
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
Plinys from classical antiquity, but it is quite impossible to recount
them here.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a> What they all have in common is the friendliness
of the dolphin for human beings, their rescue of them when
they were thrown into the sea, their playfulness, especially with
children, and their interest in almost any sort of sound. All these
traits came to be regarded as mythical by later and more sophisticated
ages, and Usener (<i>Die Sintfluthsagen</i>) comments on the
effect that the prevalence of these tales had even upon the scientific
thought of antiquity, making it difficult for such thinkers
as Aristotle to get away from the belief in the dolphin&rsquo;s ability
to carry a rider, and in its capacity for human feeling (Aristotle,
<i>History of Animals</i>, 631a). But Aristotle was right and Herr
Usener wrong. The delightful thing about most of these myths
is that they all appear to be based on solid fact, and not on the
fancies attributed to the original narrators. Another typical modern
gloss by a highly sophisticated writer, biologically not unknowledgeable,
Norman Douglas, is the following: Commenting
on the delphic mythology, he writes, &ldquo;From these and many
other sources, we may gather that there was supposed to exist
an obscure but powerful bond of affection between this animal
and humanity, and that it was endowed with a certain kindheartedness
and man-loving propensity. This is obviously not
the case; the dolphin cares no more about us than cares the haddock.
What is the origin of this belief? I conjecture that the
beast was credited with these social sentiments out of what may
be called poetic reciprocation. Mankind, loving the merry gambols
and other endearing characteristics of the dolphin, which
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
has a playful trick of escorting vessels for its own amusement,
whose presence signified fair weather, and whose parental attachment
to its offspring won their esteem&mdash;quite apart from its
fabled, perhaps real, love of music or at least of noisy sounds&mdash;were
pleased to invest it with feelings akin to their own. They
were fond of the dolphin; what more natural and becoming
than that the dolphin should be fond of them?&rdquo; (<i>Birds and
Beasts of the Greek Anthology</i>, p. 161.)</p>
<p>But Douglas was undisillusionedly wrong, and the dolphins
are right, and so is the &ldquo;mankind&rdquo; that believed in their friendliness.
Though pleased to see the dolphins play, it is to be regretted
that Douglas did not mind his compass and his way, for:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Had the curteous Dolphins heard</p>
<p class="t0">One note of his, they would have dar&rsquo;d</p>
<p class="t0">To quit the waters, to enjoy</p>
<p class="t0">In banishment such melody.</p>
<p class="lr">John Hall, 1646.</p>
</div>
<p>In order to avoid any imputation that I may be attempting to
play Euhemerus<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a>
to the dolphin&rsquo;s tale, the facts may be allowed
to speak for themselves&mdash;always remembering that facts never
speak for themselves, but are at the mercy of their interpreters.
All, then, that I am concerned to show here, by citing the contemporary
evidence, is that, in essence, the so-called myths of
the ancients were based on solid facts of observation and not, as
has hitherto been supposed, on the imaginings of mythmakers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>Let us begin with a brief account of the most recent and most
thoroughly documented story of a free-dwelling dolphin&rsquo;s social
interaction with human beings. This is the story of Opo, a female
<i>Tursiops</i> that made its appearance early in 1955 at Opononi,
a small township just outside the mouth of Hokianga Harbour,
on the western side of the North Island of New Zealand. From
allowing itself at first to be rubbed with an oar or mop carried
on the fishermen&rsquo;s launches, it began to glide in near the beach
among the bathers. The cheerful <i>putt-putt</i> of a motor-launch or
of an outboard motor was an irresistible attraction for Opo, and
she would follow the boat like a dog, playing or cruising round
it. If she had an urge to wander, starting up the motor would
invariably draw her back again. Mr. Piwai Toi, a Maori farmer,
who was the first to observe Opo, writes, &ldquo;She was really and
truly a children&rsquo;s playmate. Although she played with grownups
she was really at her charming best with a crowd of children
swimming and wading. I have seen her swimming amongst
children almost begging to be petted. She had an uncanny knack
of finding out those who were gentle among her young admirers,
and keeping away from the rougher elements. If they
were all gentle then she would give of her best.&rdquo; (Antony Alpers,
<i>The Dolphin</i>, pp. 228-229.)</p>
<p>The child the dolphin favored was a thirteen-year-old girl
named Jill Baker. At fourteen Jill wrote the following account
of her experience with Opo:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think why the dolphin became so friendly with me was because
I was always gentle with her and never rushed at her as
so many bathers did. No matter how many went in the water
playing with her, as soon as I went in for a swim she would
leave all the others and go off side-by-side with me. I remember
on one occasion I went for a swim much further up the beach
than where she was playing, and I was only in the water a short
while when she bobbed up just in front of my face and gave me
such a fright. On several other occasions when I was standing
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
in the water with my legs apart she would go between them and
pick me up and carry me a short distance before dropping me
again. At first she didn&rsquo;t like the feel of my hands and would
dart away, but after a while when she realized I would not harm
her she would come up to me to be rubbed and patted. She
would quite often let me put little children on her back for a
moment or two.&rdquo; (In Antony Alpers, <i>The Dolphin</i>, p. 229.)</p>
<p>Opo&rsquo;s choice of the gentle Jill Baker for the rides which she
gave this thirteen-year-old, suggests not only a sensitive discrimination
of the qualities of human beings, but also that the reports
of similar incidents which have come down to us from antiquity
were based on similarly observed events. The one element in
these stories which seemed most difficult to accept, and which is
so often represented in ancient art, the boy riding on the back of
a dolphin, is now removed from the realm of fancy and placed
squarely in the realm of fact. It has been corroborated and sustained.</p>
<p>Mr. Antony Alpers in his book on the dolphin, and especially
that part devoted to the eyewitness accounts of Opo&rsquo;s behavior,
goes far toward establishing the fact of the dolphin&rsquo;s remarkable
capacity for rapport with human beings. But for those striking
facts I must recommend you to Mr. Alper&rsquo;s charming book.</p>
<p>The dolphin&rsquo;s extraordinary interest in and, what we will I
am sure not be far wrong in interpreting as, concern for human
beings, is dramatically told by George Llano in his report <i>Airmen
Against the Sea</i>. This report, written on survival at sea during
the Second World War, records the experience of six American
airmen, shot down over the Pacific, who found themselves
in a seven-man raft being pushed by a porpoise toward land. Unfortunately
the land was an island held by the Japanese. The
friendly porpoise must have been surprised and hurt when he
found himself being dissuaded from his pushing by being beaten
off with the oars of the airmen.</p>
<p>Dr. Llano also reports that &ldquo;Most observers noted that when
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
porpoises appeared sharks disappeared, and they frequently refer
to the &lsquo;welcome&rsquo; appearance of porpoises, whose company
they preferred to that of sharks.&rdquo; This confirms all earlier reports
that sharks are no match for the dolphin kind.</p>
<p>Dolphins have been known to push a mattress quite empty
of human beings for considerable distances at sea. Possibly it is
merely the pushing that interests them, and not the saving of
any human beings that might be atop of them.</p>
<p>Is there any evidence that dolphins save drowning swimmers?
There is.</p>
<p>In 1945 the wife of a well-known trial attorney residing in
Florida was saved from drowning by a dolphin.<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a>
This woman
had stepped into a sea with a strong undertow and was immediately
dragged under. Just before losing consciousness, she remembers
hoping that someone would push her ashore. &ldquo;With
that, someone gave me a tremendous shove, and I landed on
the beach, face down, too exhausted to turn over ... when I did,
no one was near, but in the water almost eighteen feet out a porpoise
was leaping around, and a few feet beyond him another
large fish was also leaping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this case the porpoise was almost certainly a dolphin and
the large fish a fishtail shark. A man who had observed the
events from the other side of a fence told the rescued woman
that this was the second time he had seen a drowning person
saved by a &ldquo;porpoise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More recently, on the night of February 29, 1960, Mrs. Yvonne
M. Bliss of Stuart fell from a boat off the east coast of Grand
Bahama Island in the West Indies.<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a>
&ldquo;After floating, swimming,
shedding more clothing for what seemed an eternity, I saw a
form in the water to the left of me.... It touched the side of
my hip and, thinking it must be a shark, I moved over to the
right to try to get away from it.... This change in my position
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
was to my advantage as heretofore I was bucking a cross tide
and the waves would wash over my head and I would swallow
a great deal of water. This sea animal which I knew by this time
must be a porpoise had guided me so that I was being carried
with the tide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After another eternity and being thankful that my friend
was keeping away the sharks and barracuda for which these
waters are famous, the porpoise moved back of me and came
around to my right side. I moved over to give room to my companion
and later knew that had not the porpoise done this, I
would have been going downstream to deeper and faster moving
waters. The porpoise had guided me to the section where
the water was the most shallow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shortly I touched what felt like fish netting to my feet. It
was seaweed and under that the glorious and most welcome
bottom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I turned toward shore, stumbling, losing balance, and
saying a prayer of thanks, my rescuer took off like a streak on
down the channel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reader must be left to make what he can of such occurrences.
Dr. George G. Goodwin of the American Museum of
Natural History doubts the intention of dolphins to save drowning
persons.<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a>
&ldquo;Anything floating,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;on or near the
surface of the sea will attract his attention. His first action on
approaching the object of his curiosity is to roll under it. In
doing so, something partly submerged, like the body of a drowning
person, is nudged to the surface of the water. The sea does
its part and automatically drives floating objects toward the
beach.&rdquo; This may well be so in some cases, but it is an explanation
which does not fit the incidents described by Mrs. Bliss, in
which she was not pushed but guided. Occam&rsquo;s razor should
not be too bluntly applied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>The cooperativeness of dolphins with fishermen in various
parts of the world has gone on for several thousand years without
its significance having registered much upon the consciousness
of the rest of the world&mdash;including the learned and the
scientific.</p>
<p>In the Mediterranean from the earliest days, as recorded by
Aelian in his <i>On the Characteristics of Animals</i>, VI, 15, to the
present day, torchlight fishing with the aid of dolphins has been
a traditional way of fishing. This has been described by Nicholas
Apostolides in his book <i>La P&ecirc;che en Gr&egrave;ce</i>, who tells how fishermen
of the Sporades catch their garfish &ldquo;in the darkest nights of
the month of October&rdquo; by methods very similar to those described
by Aelian. Briefly, the fish attracted by the fishermen&rsquo;s
flares begin to collect, whereupon the dolphins appear and drive
them into the fishermen&rsquo;s nets.</p>
<p>Similar methods of fishing were practiced in the Antipodes,
off the New Zealand and Queensland coasts. The aborigines of
Moreton Bay, Queensland, used to catch mullet with the aid of
dolphins, at a place appropriately enough called Amity Point.
The aborigines recognized individual dolphins and called them
by name. With their nets ready on the beach the aborigines
waited for a shoal of fish to appear, whereupon they would run
down and make a peculiar splashing in the water with their
spears, and the dolphins on the outside of the shoal would drive
the fish towards the nets for the aborigines to catch. Fairholme,
who described these events in 1856, writes, &ldquo;For my part I cannot
doubt that the understanding is real, and that the natives
know these porpoises [actually the dolphin <i>Tursiops catalania</i>],
and that strange porpoises would not show so little fear of the
natives. The oldest men of the tribe say that the same kind of
fishing has always been carried on as long as they can remember.
Porpoises abound in the bay, but in no other part do the natives
fish with their assistance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Irrawaddy River dolphin is also an assistant-fisherman.
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
John Anderson reports that &ldquo;The fishermen believe that the dolphin
purposely draws fish to their nets, and each fishing village
has its particular guardian dolphin which receives a name common
to all the fellows of his school; and it is this superstition
which makes it so difficult to obtain specimens of this Cetacean.
Colonel Sladen has told me that suits are not infrequently
brought into the native courts to recover a share in the capture
of fish, in which a plaintiff&rsquo;s dolphin has been held to fill the nets
of rival fishermen.&rdquo; (John Anderson, <i>Account of the Zoological
Results of Two Expeditions to Western Yunnan</i>.)</p>
<p>The Pink-Bellied river dolphin (<i>Inia geoffrensis</i>) of the Trapaj&oacute;s,
a tributary of the Amazon, also helps its human friends with fishing.
Dr. F. Bruce Lamb<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a> says that this dolphin, locally known
as the <i>boto</i>, &ldquo;is reported to have saved the lives of helpless persons
whose boats have capsized, by pushing them ashore. None of
the dreaded flesh-eating <i>piranhas</i> appear when a porpoise is
present, for they themselves would be eaten.&rdquo; And he goes on
to give an eye-witness account of fishing with the aid of a trained
dolphin. &ldquo;My curiosity was aroused,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;by the paddler,
who began tapping on the side of the canoe with his paddle
between strokes and whistling a peculiar call. Asking Rymundo
about this, he startled me by casually remarking that they were
calling their <i>boto</i>, their porpoise.... As we approached the fishing
grounds near the riverbank, Rymundo lit his carbide miner&rsquo;s
lamp, adjusted the reflector, chose his first harpoon, and stood up
in the bow ready for action. Almost immediately on the offshore
side of the canoe about 50 feet from us we heard a porpoise come
up to blow and take in fresh air.&rdquo; The porpoise then chased the
fish toward the canoe and Rymundo harpooned them with ease.</p>
<p>Many ancient writers have referred to the brilliancy of the
changeful colors when the dolphin is dying. Byron makes reference
to this in &ldquo;Childe Harold&rsquo;s Pilgrimage,&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t7">&ldquo;Parting day</p>
<p class="t0">Dies like the dolphin, whom each pang imbues</p>
<p class="t0">With a new colour as it gasps away;</p>
<p class="t0">The last still loveliest, till &rsquo;tis gone, and</p>
<p class="t7">all is gray.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Here is a peculiar confusion, for this is not the mammalian
dolphin of which we have been speaking, but the swift piscivorous
oceanic fish <i>Coryphaena hippurus</i>, the dolphin of sailors. It
is blue with deeper spots, and gleaming with gold. It is, indeed,
famous for the beauty of its changing colors when dying. The
mammalian dolphin exhibits no such spectacular color changes
when dying.</p>
<p>Happily, it is not with dying dolphins or with <i>their</i> changing
colors that we are concerned here, but rather with ours, the
changing color of the complexion of our once too sophisticated
beliefs. Beliefs which, in their own way, were very much more
in the nature of myths than the ancient ones which we wrote
off a little too disdainfully as such. The history of the dolphin
constitutes an illuminating example of the eclipse of knowledge
once possessed by the learned, but which was virtually completely
relegated to the outermost fringes of mythology during
the last eighteen hundred years. Perhaps there is a moral to be
drawn here. If so, I shall leave it to others to draw. But now
that scientific interest in the dolphin has been aroused we are
entering into a new era of delphinology, and with the confirmation
of so many of the observations of the ancients already made,
we may look forward with confidence to others. Dolphins have
large brains; possibly they will some day be able to teach us
what brains are really for.</p>

<p>It was an ancient belief, as Camerarius tells us, that &ldquo;when tempests
arise, and seamen cast their anchor, the dolphin, from its love to man,
twines itself round it, so that it may more safely lay hold of the
ground.&rdquo; I know of no verifying evidence for this statement, but
should not be surprised to find some element of truth in it. The
dolphin twined about an anchor is the device which Aldus Manutius
(1450-1515) adopted for his Aldine Press, which began publication
in 1494. This device was later adapted to his own use by the English
publisher William Pickering (1796-1854).</p>
<p>The representation of the dolphin twined about the anchor refers
to no maritime supremacy of that creature, but rather to its kindly
regard for man. The following poem in George Wither&rsquo;s <i>A Collection
of Emblemes</i> (1635), throws some additional light on the meaning
of the emblem.</p>

<div class="fnblock"><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_1" href="#fr_1">[1]</a>Among the many well-known figures of classical mythology said to have been
saved by dolphins from the sea are Eikadios, Enalos, Koiranos, Phalanthos, Taras, etc.
In many other cases the corpses were brought ashore by a dolphin, which then expired
on reaching land (similarly, with minor variations, was this so with Palaimon or
Melikertes, Dionysios and Hermias of Iasos, Hesiod, and the boys already referred
to from Baiae and Naupaktos). Similar incidents reappear in the writings of the hagiographers.
Saints Martinianos of Kaisareia, Kallistratos of Carthage, Basileios the
younger of Constantinople, were each saved from a watery grave by a couple of dolphins.
The corpse of Saint Loukianos of Antioch was brought ashore by a large
dolphin, which then expired on the sand. See Klement, <i>Arion</i>, 1-64, and Usener, <i>Die
Sintfluthsagen</i>, 138-180.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_2" href="#fr_2">[2]</a>Euhemerus (<i>circa</i> second half of the fourth century B.C.) attempted a rationalistic
explanation of the mythology prevailing in his time. The theory he propounded, in his
novel of travel, <i>Sacred History</i>, was simply an extension of the current skeptical-scientific
attitude to matters which until that time had been accepted without question.
That theory was that the gods were merely men who because of their great exploits
or beneficence had been accorded divine honors. In Crete, coming upon the remains
of a tomb bearing the name of Zeus, Euhemerus argued that even Zeus had probably
been no more than a great conqueror, who died and was buried in Crete, and afterwards
deified. This creditable anthropological attempt to historicize mythology, though
it failed to convince, is nevertheless worthy of great respect. As A. B. Cook wrote, if
Euhemerus said that Zeus was a Cretan king when he ought to have said that Cretan
kings played the part of Zeus, it is a pardonable error. (<i>Zeus</i>, I, 662.)

<h2 id="c26"><span class="small"><i>Modern Whales, Dolphins, and Porpoises, as Challenges to Our Intelligence</i></span></h2>
<p class="center">By JOHN C. LILLY</p>
<p>The intelligence of whales has been the subject
of speculation by writers since Ancient Greece.<a class="fn" href="#fnx1">[1]</a><a class="fn" href="#fnx2">[2]</a> The discovery
of the large brains of the Cetacea in the eighteenth century led
to inevitable comparisons of these brains to those of the humans
and of the lower primates. The winds of scholarly opinions
concerning the whales have anciently blown strongly for high
intelligence but during later centuries shifted strongly against
high intelligence. At the time of Aristotle (384-322 B.C.) the
dolphin, for example, was held in high esteem, and many stories
of the apparently great abilities of these animals were current.<a class="fn" href="#fnx2">[2]</a>
By the time of Plinius Secundus (A.D. 23-79) the beginning of
a note of skepticism was introduced. Plinius said, &ldquo;I should be
ashamed to tell the story were it not that it has been written
about by ... others.&rdquo;<a class="fn" href="#fnx1">[1]</a></p>
<p>In the middle ages the strong influence of religious philosophy
on thinking placed Man in a completely separate compartment
from all other living creatures, and the accurate anatomy of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
whales was neglected. This point is illustrated by <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>, published
in the 1500&rsquo;s in <i>Historia Animalium</i> by Konrad Gesner.
This was apparently a baleen whale. It has two tubes which apparently
symbolize the double blowhole of the Mystacocetae.
There is no modern whale known that has such tubes sticking
out of the top of his head. There is a huge eye above the angle
of the jaw. All whales have the eye at or near the posterior angle
of the jaw. The eye is very much smaller than the one shown
here. A print published in 1598 of the anatomy of these animals
is shown in <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>. The drawing of the male organ is accurate
(apparently it was measured with a walking stick), but the eye
is too large and is misplaced.</p>
<p>These pictures illustrate very well man&rsquo;s most common relationship
to the whale, which has continued to the present day.
For commercial reasons man continues to exploit these creatures&rsquo;
bodies.</p>
<p>It was not until the anatomical work of Vesalius and others
that the biological similarities and differences of man and other
mammals were pointed out. It was at this time that the investigation
of man&rsquo;s large and complex brain began.</p>
<p>All through these periods intelligence and the biological brain
factors seemed to be completely separated in the minds of the
scholars. At the times of the Greeks and the Romans there was
little, if any, link made between brain and mind. Scholars attributed
man&rsquo;s special achievements to other factors than excellence
of brain structure and its use.</p>
<p>After the discovery of man&rsquo;s complicated and complex brain
and the clinical correlation between brain injury and effects on
man&rsquo;s performance, the brain and mental factors began to be
related to one another. As descriptions of man&rsquo;s brain became
more and more exact and clinical correlations increased sufficiently
in numbers, new investigations on the relationships between
brain size and intelligence in <i>Homo sapiens</i> were started.
The early work is summarized by Donaldson.<a class="fn" href="#fnx3">[3]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>In the late 1700&rsquo;s and the early 1800&rsquo;s the expansion of the
whaling industry offered many opportunities for examination
of these interesting mammals. Figures <a href="#fig3">3</a> and <a href="#fig4">4</a> are dramatic examples
of the state of the industry in the late eighteenth and
early nineteenth centuries.</p>
<p>One of the earliest drawings of the complex brain of one of
the cetacea is that of Gottfried Reinhold Trediramus in 1818
(<a href="#fig5">Fig. 5</a>). This is an anterior view of the brain of the common
porpoise <i>Phocaena phocaena</i>. This is one of the earliest pictures
showing the complexity of the fissuration and the large numbers
of gyri and sulci.</p>
<p>By the year 1843 the size of the brain of whales was being related
to the total size of the body. The very large brains of the
large whales were reduced in importance by considering their
weight in a ratio to the weight of the total body. This type of
reasoning was culminated with a long series of quantitative
measures published by Eug&egrave;ne Dubois (<i>Bulletins de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute;
d&rsquo;Anthropologie de Paris</i>, Ser. 4, VIII [1897], 337-376).</p>
<p>Descriptions from those of Hunter and Tyson onwards agree
that, in absolute size, the brains are as large and larger than
those of man. All were agreed that the smaller whales, i.e., the
dolphins and porpoises, have very large brains with relation to
their body size. It was argued, therefore, with respect to the
dolphin, &ldquo;this creature is of more than ordinary wit and capacity.&rdquo;
(Robert Hamilton, <i>The Natural History of the Ordinary
Cetacea or Whales</i>, p. 66, in Sir William Jardine, <i>The
Naturalist&rsquo;s Library</i>, volume 7, Edinburgh, 1843.)</p>
<p>Tiedemann&rsquo;s drawings of the brain of <i>Delphinus delphis</i> and
of <i>Delphinus phocaena</i> were published by H. G. L. Reichenbach
in his <i>Anatomia Mammalium</i> in 1845. The four drawings are
shown in <a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>. These drawings show the improved awareness
of the complexities of these large brains in regard to cerebral
cortex, the cerebellum, and the cranial nerves. Correlations
between the structure of this brain and the behavior of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
animal possessing it, were (and are) woefully lacking. The only
behavioral accounts were those of whalers hunting these
animals. Hunters tend to concentrate on the offensive and defensive
maneuvers of the animal, and can give useful information
for other kinds of evaluation of the animal&rsquo;s behavior and
presumed intelligence.</p>
<p>In 1787 John Hunter, writing in the <i>Philosophical Transactions
of the Royal Society of London</i> (LXXVII, 423-424), said
the following: &ldquo;The size of the Brain differs much in different
genera of this tribe, and likewise in the proportion it bears to the
bulk of the animal. In the Porpoise, I believe, it [the proportion]
is largest, and perhaps in that respect comes nearest to the human....</p>
<p>&ldquo;The brain is composed of cortical and medullary substances,
very distinctly marked; the cortical being, in colour, like the
tubular substance of a kidney; the medullary, very white. These
substances are nearly in the same proportion as in the human
brain.... The thalami themselves are large; the corpora striata
small; the crura of the fornix are continued along the windings
of the ventricles, much as in the human subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flatau and Jacobsohn in 1899 wrote, &ldquo;the large brain of the
Porpoise is one of the smallest in the Cetacean Order in which
the organ attains to a much greater absolute size than any
other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1902 G. Elliot Smith wrote of the brain of a species of
dolphin called &ldquo;Delphinus tursio&rdquo; (which may be the modern
<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>): &ldquo;This brain is larger and correspondingly
richer in sulci than that of the porpoise: but the structure of the
two organs is essentially the same.&rdquo; His drawings are shown in
Figures <a href="#fig7">7</a> and <a href="#fig8">8</a>. He said further, &ldquo;the brains of the Beluga and
all the dolphins closely resemble that of the porpoise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smith summarizes the discussion of the huge size of the
whale&rsquo;s brain. &ldquo;The apparently extraordinary dimensions of the
whale&rsquo;s brain cannot therefore be considered unusual phenomena,
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
because this enormous extent of the cerebral cortex to
receive and &lsquo;store&rsquo; impressions of such vast sensory surfaces becomes
a condition of survival of the animal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The marvelous complexity of the surface of the cerebrum is
the direct result of its great size. In order, apparently, that the
cerebral cortex may be efficiently nourished and at the same time
be spared to as great a degree as possible the risk of vascular disturbances
[such as would be produced by large vessels passing
into it], its thickness does not appreciably increase in large
animals. [He then quotes Dubois&rsquo; figures showing that the
whale&rsquo;s cortex is the same thickness as that of the human.] Such
being the case, it naturally results that the increased bulk of cortex
in large animals can only be packed by becoming thrown
into increasing number of folds, separated by corresponding
large number of sulci.&rdquo;<a class="fn" href="#fnx4">[4]</a></p>
<p>In regard to communication between individual whales,
Scammon in 1874 wrote the following: &ldquo;It is said that the Cachalots
[Sperm Whales] are endowed with the faculty of communicating
with each other in times of danger, when miles ... distant.
If this be true, the mode of communication rests instinctively
within their own contracted brains.&rdquo;<a class="fn" href="#fnx5">[5]</a> Let us not forget that
Scammon was talking about the mammal with the largest
known brain on this planet. Instinct as the sole cause of communication
with a brain this size seems rather improbable. This
brain is not any longer considered &ldquo;contracted.&rdquo; Both of these
statements illustrate an authoritative view of that time. If one
peruses the paper by Tokuzo Kojima, &ldquo;On the Brain of the
Sperm Whale&rdquo; (in the <i>Scientific Reports</i> of the Whales Research
Institute, Tokyo, VI, 1951, 49-72), one can obtain a
modern clear view of this brain. The largest one that he obtained
(from a 49-foot sperm whale) was 9,200 grams. The
average weight of the sixteen brains presented in his paper is
7,800 grams for average body lengths of 50 feet. (The brain
weight per foot of body length varied from 118 to 187 grams
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
per foot, averaging 157; man&rsquo;s ratio averages about 250 grams
per foot.)</p>
<p>In the literature of the time of Scammon, the scholars failed to
give us new information about the behavior of cetacea. There
seems to have been a distinctly ambivalent attitude towards these
animals which is continued today. This point of view can be
summarized as follows: the whale is a very large animal with a
brain larger than that of man. This brain is the result of the
huge growth of its body. All of this large brain is needed to
control a large body. Because these tasks are so demanding,
there is not enough brain substance left for a high degree of
intelligence to develop. Thus the large brain cannot give the
degree of intellectual capability that man has.</p>
<p>As an example of man&rsquo;s attitudes to cetaceans, consider the
case of the U. S. Fisheries Bureau <i>Economic Circular</i> No. 38,
of November 6, 1918, by Lewis Radcliffe, entitled &ldquo;Whales and
Porpoises as Food.&rdquo; Roy Chapman Andrews is quoted as saying
that hump-backed whale meat is the best of the larger cetaceans
but that porpoise and dolphin meat is even better eating than
that of the larger whale. The composition of the whale meat is
given as 30% protein, 6% fat, and less than 2% ash. From a
hump-back whale one obtains six tons of meat, from a Sei Whale,
five tons, and from a Finback, eight tons. Directions are given
to remove the connective tissue between the blubber and the
muscle to avoid the oily taste. For those who are interested, the
paper includes twenty-two whale meat recipes and ten porpoise
meat recipes.</p>
<p>It can well be imagined, if we ever do communicate with
whales, dolphins, or porpoises, the kind of reception that this
sort of literature will receive from the cetaceans.</p>
<p>The limited point of view of the whales as &ldquo;dumb beasts&rdquo;
neglects the adaptations that have taken place in non-mammalian
forms with very much smaller brains but with comparable
bulk of body. The 60-foot whale shark, a plankton eater,
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
and like the rest of the sharks a water-breather, has a bulk of
body comparable to that of the larger whales. It has a large
brain cavity but a very small brain in a small part of this large
cavity. (It is very difficult to find the weight of these brains to
compare with that of the cetacea and other mammals.) The
problem of brain weight versus body weight versus intelligence
is most clearly expressed by Gerhardt von Bonin in his paper in
the <i>Journal of General Psychology</i> (1937).<a class="fn" href="#fnx6">[6]</a> He gives a very extensive
table for mammals, their brain weight, their body
weight, and the values of 2 parameters for their specification.
He then states, &ldquo;it is clear from all that has been said above that
the figures given here are nothing but a description of facts, a
description which, in the mathematical sense of the term, is the
&lsquo;best&rsquo; one. It does not pretend to make any enunciation about
the relation of intelligence and brain weight. For that purpose
we need a much broader psychological basis than we have at
present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Former attempts to analyze the relations between body
weight and brain weight suffer from three deficits: (1) they
presuppose a correlation between intelligence and brain weight,
(2) they make suppositions about the intelligence of animals
which are unproven, and (3) they are based on a conception of
cortical function which can no longer be considered valid....
There is a close correlation between the logarithms of brain and
body weight, and this co-relation is linear. Brain weight increases
as the 0.655th power of body weight. The value of the
cephalization co-efficient k differs from species to species.
<i>Whether or not this is an indication of the intelligence of
animals must be left to the psychologists to answer.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the problems that the whales have, as compared to,
say, the large shark, is breathing air while living in the sea. This
requires that these animals reach the air-water interface relatively
frequently&mdash;at least every one hour and a half for the
bottlenose whale (<i>Hypero&ouml;don</i>), three-quarters of an hour for
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
the Sperm Whale (<i>Physeter catadon</i>), and every six minutes for
<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>. This puts very stringent requirements on the
relationship of the whales to other events within the sea. Each
whale must know where the surface of the sea is at each instant
and compute his future actions so that when he does run out of
air he is near the surface. He is essentially a surface-to-depth and
depth-to-surface oriented animal. He must travel at high speed
at times in order to recapture enough air to continue whatever
he is doing under the surface. This means that he must calculate
his chances of obtaining a good breath of air during rain
storms and similar situations. He can be violently thrown
around at the surface unless he comes up in the trough rather
than at the crest of the wave. Such calculations probably require
an exercise of something more than just &ldquo;instinct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Water-breathing animals, on the other hand, have no need for
such calculations. If the surface gets rough, they move downward
and stay there. The required maneuvers are very much
simpler and the amount of computation is very much less.</p>
<p>This requirement for the whales implies that the information
coming from every one of the senses, not just the skin, needs to
be correlated very rapidly and in complex patterning to allow
the animals to predict their future course safely and accurately.
It also requires the use of large amounts of information from
memory.</p>
<p>The predators of the sea, other than the whales themselves,
make life in the sea rather a complex business for mammals. The
very large sharks can and do attack whales, dolphins, and porpoises.
At times such attacks are by overwhelming numbers of
sharks on a relatively small number of dolphins. All of the older
animals in our experience have at least one shark bite on them&mdash;the
younger animals are protected by the older ones and most of
them are not so dramatically scarred.</p>
<p>The whales, in turn, must track their own prey in order to
obtain food. With the single known exception of <i>Orca</i>, none of
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
their predators are air-breathers. In general, the whales&rsquo; diet
consists of fish, squid, or other water-breathing organisms of the
sea.</p>
<p>A scientific assessment of the position of these animals in the
competitive environment of the sea is not yet fully evaluated
quantitatively. Any pronouncement of the requirements in regard
to new complex adaptations to new complicated situations
and hence the evaluation of intelligence of these animals at this
time is premature and presumptuous. The whole issue of the
meaning and the use of these large brains is still very much unknown.
As I say in <i>Man and Dolphin</i>,<a class="fn" href="#fnx7">[7]</a> I am espousing a plea
for an open-minded attitude with respect to these animals. It
would be presumptuous to assume that we at the present time
can know how to measure their intelligence or their intellectual
capacity. The usual behavioral criteria used in evaluation of intelligence
of other animals are obviously inapplicable to a mammal
living in the sea. As McBride and Hebb<a class="fn" href="#fnx8">[8]</a> so clearly stated,
they cannot place the dolphin in any sort of intellectual comparative
intelligence scale; they did not know the appropriate
experimental questions to ask in order to compare the dolphins
with the chimpanzees, for example. Comparing a handed-mammal
with a flippered-mammal, each of which lives in an
entirely separate and distinctive environment, is a very difficult
intellectual task even for <i>Homo sapiens</i>.</p>
<p>In pursuing possible measures of intellectual and intelligent
capacity, what line should one pursue? I explored this question
somewhat in <i>Man and Dolphin</i>, but wish to summarize and extend
it here in this discussion. The invariants that we are seeking
somehow do not seem to be as concrete as &ldquo;tool-making and
tool-using ability&rdquo; by means of the hands which has been one of
the major alleged criteria for human adaptation and success.
The chimpanzee and the gorilla have the hands but they do
not have the brains to back up the use of the hands. Man has
both the hands and the brain. Thus we can quite simply and
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
concretely contrast the performance of the large brains of man
with his hands to the smaller brains of the primates with their
hands. When we consider the whales, we seem obsessed, as it
were, with the necessity of our own nature to look for an analog
of the hand and the manipulative ability. May it not be better to
find a more general principle than just handedness and its use?</p>
<p>I suggest that we think more in terms of a physiologically appropriate
set of more general mechanisms which may subsume
several other human functions under the same principle. It
seems to me that we must look for abilities to develop generalized
dexterity of use for certain kinds of end purposes for
any or all muscular outputs from the central nervous system. If
there is a task to be done, such as lifting a stone, whether in
water or air, a given animal may turn it over with his foot, with
his flipper, with his hand, with his tail, or with any other body
part with which he could obtain a purchase on the stone. The
end task is turning over the stone, to obtain food or whatever.
It makes little difference what kind of muscular equipment he
uses just so he uses it appropriately.</p>
<p>Let me illustrate with a more complex example seen in our
own laboratory. A baby dolphin was being nursed in a small
tank artificially. It apparently needed the constant attention of
a human attendant. Its mother had not been caught with it.
After several days it discovered that if it banged on the bottom
of the tank with its flipper in a rhythmic fashion it could bring
the humans from the other room. (We heard a loud thumping
sound transmitted from a hydrophone in its tank.) Previous to
this it attempted to bring the humans from the other room by
whistling the distress call of the dolphins; unlike its mother, the
humans did not respond to the whistle. In a sense this distress
call is in his instinctual pattern for obtaining food and aid by
other dolphins. The secondary adaptation and the new effort
was that of manipulating the flipper rather than the phonation
mechanism in the blowhole. Thus driven by whatever the instinctual
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
need is, it tried different outputs from its brain and
finally discovered one which brought the desired results. This
ability to change the output from unsuccessful ones to successful
ones seems to me to be evidence of a &ldquo;higher nervous system&rdquo;
function. Of course in fine gradation and small differences, the
same kind of pattern can be shown for smaller-brained animals.
It is the seeking a new output, not necessarily instinctually tied
in, and the radicalness of the change of output, plus the relating
of many of the variables to one another thus generating the new
output, that seems to be the hallmark of the large brain. These
problems are not single variable ones with simple cause and
effect, but are simultaneous multiple variable ones.</p>
<p>Among the manipulable outputs (muscular groups) I would
include those of respiration and phonation. The dexterous and
finely differentiated use of these muscles generates all the complexities
of human speech. As more of the physiology and psychology
of human speech are analyzed and made part of our
sciences, the sharper will be our criteria for separating man from
the other animals, and from those with smaller brains. Scientific
descriptions of human speech are of relatively recent origin.
Scientific descriptions of the physiology of the vocal tract are
anything but a closed book at the present time. The neuroanatomy
and neurophysiology of speech is in a relatively primitive
state of development as a science. With such a lack of knowledge
of the intimate and detailed mechanisms concerned, it
would be rather presumptuous to evaluate at the present time
their role in the measurement and testing of intelligence and
intellectual capacity.</p>
<p>However, I wish to point out that these factors are important
in such an evaluation and become even more important in terms
of evaluating a species that is not human. Thus it is necessary,
in order to evaluate the intelligence of even the dolphins, much
less the whales, to know something of their abilities in the areas
of phonation and other kinds of bodily gestures and manipulations
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
and hence in their abilities to communicate with one another.
As I implied in <i>Man and Dolphin</i>, it is not possible to
measure accurately the intelligence of any other being than that
of a human being, mainly because we do not exchange ideas
through any known communication mode with such beings.</p>
<p>The difficulties of such understanding as we can possibly gain
of the real situation of the whales in the sea and their adaptation
as mammals to this particular environment, can be illustrated by
their use of sonic generators for the location of their prey and of
the boundaries of their container by means of the perception of
echoes. As is well known, the small mammals, such as the bat,
use this mechanism in air.<a class="fn" href="#fnx9">[9]</a> The bottlenose dolphin also uses this
same kind of mechanism underwater.<a class="fn" href="#fnx7">[7]</a><a class="fn" href="#fnx9">[9]</a><a class="fn" href="#fnx10">[10]</a> Because these animals
are immersed in a medium of a density and a sound velocity
comparable to the density and sound velocity of their own bodies,
they can presumably use their sonar also in looking, as it were,
inside one another&rsquo;s body.<a class="fn" href="#fnx7">[7]</a> The sonar view of the inside of the
body of a dolphin may possibly be very instructive to other
dolphins and possibly even aid in diagnosis of the causes of certain
problems, especially of those of the baby by the mother. For
example, their buoyancy depends upon maintaining their center
of gravity below their center of buoyancy; otherwise they turn
over and drown. If the baby develops gas in stomach #1, he
can develop problems in his buoyancy relationship which turn
him over; however, the mother dolphin can probably easily find
out whether or not there is a bubble of gas in the baby&rsquo;s stomach
by her echo ranging abilities. When she discovers such a bubble,
she can then burp the baby by banging on the belly with her
beak. We have seen such operations take place in our tanks.
Here is another instance of the animal using a given output,
coupled with the proper input, to diagnose a problem and to
manipulate other outputs in the solution of that problem. How
much of this is labeled &ldquo;instinctual,&rdquo; i.e., &ldquo;unlearned,&rdquo; is purely a
matter of intellectual taste.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>In the sea it is necessary to use sonic mechanisms for sightings
and recognition. If one goes into the sea one realizes that one&rsquo;s
range of vision even under the best of circumstances is rarely
beyond 100 feet and most of the time is less than that even near
the brilliantly lit surface of the tropical seas. With sonic means,
one&rsquo;s range is extended up to several miles under the best of
circumstances and under the worst to a few hundred feet.</p>
<p>Recently we have obtained evidence that shows that the
dolphins communicate most of their information in the band of
frequencies extending from about 8 kilocycles to 20 kilocycles
by means of whistles and sonic clicks.<a class="fn" href="#fnx11">[11]</a> However, as shown by
Schevill and Lawrence, they can hear sounds at least to 120 kilocycles<a class="fn" href="#fnx12">[12]</a>
and as shown by Kellogg can produce sounds at least
to 170 kilocycles.<a class="fn" href="#fnx10">[10]</a> We have recently been investigating the
higher frequency bands in these animals and have reliable
evidence that they can hear at least to 200 kilocycles and can
produce sounds to at least 200 kilocycles.<a class="fn" href="#fnx7">[7]</a><a class="fn" href="#fnx13">[13]</a> With the proper
electronic equipment one can listen to the nearer portions of the
upper band and quickly determine that they can transmit in
these bands without the necessity of transmitting in the (lower
frequency) communication band. The high frequency information
is broadcast in a narrow beam off the front of the beak as
was first detected by Kenneth Norris.<a class="fn" href="#fnx14">[14]</a></p>
<p>In these bands we find that they can produce musical tones
or individual clickings or hissing-like noises. Recently we have
found that an emotionally upset animal threatens other animals
and humans by productions of very large amounts of energy
both in the sonic communication band and in the ultrasonic
bands. Recently we have had the opportunity of working with
an old bull of 450 pounds weight who is so old his teeth have
been ground down flat. In terms of his skeleton, he is the most
massive animal we have ever seen. When he is irritated, his
&ldquo;barks&rdquo; have sizable amounts of energy from about 0.5 to at
least 300 kilocycles. He is also capable of transmitting in bands
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
between 100 to 300 kilocycles without transmitting anything in
the band from 8 kilocycles to 20 kilocycles in a narrow beam
straight ahead of his body. When he is upset by the activities of
a younger male, they face one another and blast at one another
with short barks of this sort, meanwhile &ldquo;threatening&rdquo; by opening
their mouths.</p>
<p>Since they live immersed in an acoustic world quite strange to
us, we have great difficulty in appreciating the full life of these
animals with respect to one another and their environment.
From birth they are constantly bombarded with signals from the
other animals of the same species and by echoes from the environment
which they can apparently use very efficiently. Their
ultrasonic (to us) emissions are not merely &ldquo;sonar,&rdquo; but are interpersonal
and even emotional. These animals are not inanimate,
cold pieces of sonar apparatus. They use their ultrasounds and
their high-pitched sounds interpersonally with fervor in everything
they do.<a class="fn" href="#fnx15">[15]</a></p>
<p>We have demonstrated that the dolphins are quite capable of
using vocal outputs as a demand for further rewards or for
surcease from punishment. Their ability in the vocal sphere is
quite sophisticated. In addition to the ultrasonic matters mentioned
above, their sonic performance, when in close contact
with man, is astonishing. In 1957 I discovered their ability to
produce sounds similar to our speech sounds.<a class="fn" href="#fnx16">[16]</a> During the last
two years we have had many opportunities to pursue further
observations in this area. This emerging ability seems to be an
adaptation to a new environment which includes Man.<a class="fn" href="#fnx17">[17]</a> They
quickly discover that they can obtain various kinds of rewards
by making what we now call &ldquo;humanoid emissions.&rdquo; When
they make a sound which sounds similar to a human syllable or
word, we express our pleasure by rewarding the animals in
various ways. We have been exploring what some of these rewards
are in order to elicit further such behavior under better
control.</p>

<p>We demonstrated that, like other animals, the monkey, the
rat, etc., these animals can be rewarded by stimulating the
proper places in their brains.<a class="fn" href="#fnx16">[16]</a><a class="fn" href="#fnx18">[18]</a> In a recent series of experiments
we have been establishing the controls necessary to understanding
what brain rewards mean in terms of natural physiology.
We have demonstrated quite formally that rubbing the skin of
these animals with our hands is a rewarding experience to them;
they will seek it vocally and by body gestures and give certain
kinds of performance in order to obtain this reward.</p>
<p>Recently we have found that &ldquo;vocal transactions&rdquo; are a reward
to these animals.<a class="fn" href="#fnx7">[7]</a><a class="fn" href="#fnx13">[13]</a> (See below for human analogies in the
child.) This seems to be one of the basic factors in our being able
to elicit humanoid emissions. The vocal transactions are started
by a human shouting some words over the water of the tank in
which the animal is residing. A single word may be used or
many words&mdash;it makes little difference. Eventually the animal
in the tank will raise his blowhole out of water and make some
sort of a humanoid emission or whistle or clicks in a delphinese
fashion. If the human immediately replies with some word or
words, the animal may immediately respond, the human
answers, and a vocal transaction is under way. We have shown
that dolphins naturally do this with one another in both their
whistle and clicking spheres, and sometimes do it in the barking
sphere.<a class="fn" href="#fnx13">[13]</a> How much of this is &ldquo;instinctual&rdquo; and how much is not,
there is no way of knowing at the present time.</p>
<p>A physical analysis of such vocal transactions shows them to
be formally quite as complex as the vocal transactions between
human beings. In other words, the dolphin may say one word
or a syllable-like emission, or many, one right after the other, as
may the humans. If the human says one word, the dolphin may
say one, two, three, or four, and if the human says one, two,
three, or four, the dolphin may say one. There is no necessary
master-slave kind of relationship in the delphinic emissions.</p>
<p>In our early reports we gave examples which were single
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
words which sounded like the words that the human made.<a class="fn" href="#fnx16">[16]</a><a class="fn" href="#fnx7">[7]</a>
This presentation led to misunderstandings among our scientific
colleagues. It looked as if the animals were doing a slavish
tape-recorder rendition of what we were doing in a fashion
similar to that of a parrot or a Mynah bird. All along we have
known that the dolphins did not do such a slavish job and were
obviously doing a much more complicated series of actions. We
are just beginning to appreciate how to analyze and what to
analyze in these transactions. As I stated in <i>Man and Dolphin</i>
about 10% of these emissions sound like human speech. In other
words, the dolphin is &ldquo;saying&rdquo; far more than we have transmitted
to the scientific community to date. We hesitate to say
anything more about this until we begin to understand what
is going on in greater detail. We are making progress slowly.</p>
<p>Let me then make an appeal to you&mdash;a long appeal to your
logical and rational views of man and cetaceans. Here I review
the above points in more general terms, and develop a plea for a
new science&mdash;a new discipline combining the best of science
with the best of the humanities.</p>
<p>Several old questions should be revived and asked again with
a new attitude, with more modern techniques of investigation
and with more persistence. It may take twenty years or more to
develop good answers; meanwhile the intellectual life of man
will profit in the undertaking. There is something exciting and
even at times disturbing in this quest.<a class="fn" href="#fnx19">[19]</a> The bits and pieces may
have started before historical times. In each age of man a new
fragment was allowed to be recorded and passed on to subsequent
generations. Each generation judged and rejudged the
evidence from the older sources on the basis of its then current
beliefs and on the basis of its new experiences, if any. At
times good evidence was attenuated, distorted, and even destroyed
in the name of the then current dogma.</p>
<p>Today we have similar problems; our current beliefs blind
us, too. Evidence right before the eye can be distorted by the
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
eye of the beholder quite as powerfully as it has been in previous
ages of man. We can only hope that we have achieved greater
insight and greater objectivity than some of our ancestors. The
winds and currents of bias and prejudice blow hard and run
deep in the minds of men. In one&rsquo;s own mind these factors are
difficult to see, and when seen, difficult to attenuate and to allow
for their influence. If at times I scold my own species, do not
take it too personally; I am scolding myself more than you.</p>
<p>You can see by now that I believe that some of the answers to
the quest are in our own minds. We must develop, imaginatively
and humbly, numbers of alternative hypotheses to expand the
testable areas of the intellect and bring to the investigation new
mental instruments to test and to collect facts germane to our
questions.</p>
<p>To ask about the intelligence of another species, we somehow
first ask: how large and well-developed is its brain? Somewhat
blindly we link brain size (a biological fact) to intelligence (a
behavioral and psychological concept). We know, in the case of
our own species, that if the brain fails to develop, intelligence
also fails to develop.</p>
<p>How do we judge in our own species that intelligence develops
or fails to develop? We work with the child and carefully
observe its performances of common tasks and carefully
measure its acquisition of speech quantitatively. We measure
(among other factors) size of word vocabulary, adequacy of
pronunciation, lengths of phrases and sentences, appropriateness
of use, levels of abstraction achieved, and the quality of the
logical processes used. We also measure speed of grasping new
games with novel sets of rules and strategy; games physical
and/or games verbal and vocal.</p>
<p>Normal mental growth patterns of human children have been
measured extensively in both performance and in vocal speech
acquisition. I have taken the liberty of relating these to the
normal growth of brain weight of children.</p>

<p>Table 1 shows relations between age, brain weight, and speech
performance, up to 23 months, 1070 grams, and the use of full
sentences. By 17 years, the brain reaches and levels off at 1450
grams and the number of words, levels of abstraction, etc., are so
large as to be difficult to assess.</p>
<p>In these processes, what are the minimum necessary but not
necessarily sufficient factors?<a class="fn" href="#fnx20">[20]</a> On the biological side, modern
theory concentrates on two factors: total numbers of neurons
and the number of interconnections between them. On the psychological
side, modern theory concentrates on the numbers of
occurrences of reinforced contingencies experienced, the number
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
of repetitions, and the number of adequate presentations
from the accepted set of the consensus known as &ldquo;native language,&rdquo;
and the total numbers of sets in the stored memories at
a given age. In addition, of course, is the adequate development
of the transmitting and of the receiving equipment needed for
speech and its ancillary behaviors.</p>
<p>On the biological side, modern neurology says the number of
neurons in the human brain reaches maximum value before
birth at about 13 billions. After this point, the increase in weight
consists of increased numbers of fibers, increased connections, increased
size of elements, and increased efficiency and selectivity
of transmission. Thus the increase in weight of the human
brain from about 400 to 1400 grams seems to be devoted to improving
its internal (as well as external) communication, storage,
and computation networks. As I have stated elsewhere
(<i>Man and Dolphin</i>), it is my impression that there exist critical
threshold values in the brain&rsquo;s growth pattern at which certain
kinds of performance become possible. Complex speech acquisition
seems related to brain weights of 800 to 1000 grams, but no
smaller. This assumes, of course, numbers of neurons (10&sup1;&#8304;)
and numbers of connections and opportunities for learning and
time to learn commonly found with humans.</p>
<p>The critical psychological factors in speech acquisition are
slowly being dug out and described.<a class="fn" href="#fnx21">[21]</a><a class="fn" href="#fnx22">[22]</a> Among these the most
important seem to be a continuous background of presentations
to the child in rewarding circumstances of speech and its close
relations to objects, actions, satisfaction of needs, and persons.
Imitation of one&rsquo;s use of facial and vocal apparatus appears
spontaneously in the happy child. The virtuosity of the child
as a mimic is truly astonishing.</p>
<p>I am also impressed by evidence for what I call the &ldquo;transactional
drive.&rdquo; A bright child seems to seek and respond best to
those persons who respond in kind, back and forth in exchanges
of sounds and linked actions. For example, if one starts such a
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
transaction with a child of 22 months with a loud word, if he is
ready, he may return his version of the word or a slight variant;
if one replies with another variant the child replies with still a
third, or even suddenly with a new word, and so on back and
forth in a transactional vocal dance. Or one may reply to a child
who invites such an exchange to begin. Such exchanges seem
to function as rewards of themselves, and hence the name,
&ldquo;transactional drive.&rdquo; This phenomenon is more than mere mechanical
slavish mimicry. It seems to aid in perfecting pronunciation,
increases vocabulary, increases the bonds with other
persons, serves to substitute the &ldquo;consensus-dictionary&rdquo; words
for the private baby words, and is thus essential to learning a
language of one&rsquo;s own species. It is thus that the child &ldquo;becomes
human.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the child ages and grows, the exchanges lengthen, and the
time during which each member of the dyad is quiet while the
other speaks becomes longer, until finally for a half hour or so,
I am lecturing and you are at least quiet, if not listening.</p>
<p>How does all of this relate to modern dolphins, porpoises, and
whales? From the vast array of scientific facts and theories about
our own species, a few of those which I feel are useful in approaching
another species to evaluate its intelligence are discussed
above. But before I make connections there, let us attenuate
some interfering attitudes and points of view, some myths
not so modern; these interfering presumptions can be stated as
follows:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>(1) No animal has a language comparable to a human language.</dt>
<dt>(2) No animal is as intelligent as man.</dt>
<dt>(3) Man can adapt himself to any environment quite as well as any animal.</dt>
<dt>(4) Intelligence and intellect can be expressed only in the ways man expresses or has expressed them.</dt>
<dt>(5) All animal behavior is instinct-determined.</dt>
<dt>(6) None of man&rsquo;s thought and behavior is so determined.</dt>
<dt class="pb" id="Page_51">51</dt>
<dt>(7) Only man thinks and plans; animals are incapable of having a mental life.</dt>
<dt>(8) Philosophy and contemplative and analytic thought are characteristic only of man, not of any animal.</dt></dl>
<p>All of these statements stem from ignorance and anthropocentricity.
For example, who are we to say that whales, dolphins,
and porpoises are to be included as &ldquo;dumb beasts&rdquo;? It would be
far more objective and humble to tell the truth&mdash;we don&rsquo;t know
about these animals because we haven&rsquo;t &ldquo;been there yet.&rdquo; We
have not lived in the sea, naked and alone, or even in mobile
groups, without steel containers to keep out the sea itself. For
purposes of discussion let us make the following assumptions
which push counter to the current of bias running deep among
us:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>(1) Man has not yet been willing to investigate the possibility of another intelligent species.</dt>
<dt>(2) Whales, dolphins, and porpoises are assumed to be &ldquo;dumb beasts&rdquo; with little or no evidence for this presumption.</dt>
<dt>(3) We do not yet know very much about these animals&mdash;their necessities, their intelligences, their lives, the possibility of their communications.</dt>
<dt>(4) It is possible for man to investigate these matters objectively with courage and perseverance.</dt>
<dt>(5) To properly evaluate whales, dolphins, porpoises, we must use everything we have intellectually, all available knowledge, <i>humanistic</i> as well as <i>scientific</i>.</dt></dl>
<p>Our best knowledge of ourselves as a species, as humans, is in
the humanities and in the budding, growing sciences of man.
In pursuit of understanding of the whales, dolphins, and porpoises,
we need, at least at the beginning, a large view which
is in the human sciences and in the humanities. The sciences of
animals are necessarily restrictive in their view, and hence not
yet applicable to our problems.</p>
<p>The history of the animal sciences shows that they have had
grave difficulties with the fact that the observers are present and
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
human. These sciences, like physics, chemistry, and biology, play
the game as if the human observer were not there and the systems
were isolated from man. This is fine strategy for &ldquo;man-less
nature&rdquo; studies and quite appropriate for such studies.</p>
<p>However, I submit to you another view, for a science of man
and animal, their relationships to one another. Modern man and
modern dolphin and whale may be best investigated in the
framework of a new science one might call &ldquo;anthropo-zoology&rdquo;
or &ldquo;zoo-anthropology.&rdquo; This science is a deep study of man, of
the animal, of their mutual relations, present and potential. In
this discipline scientists encourage close relations with the animal,
and study the developing relation between man and so-called
&ldquo;beast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the last three years in the Communication Research Institute<a class="fn" href="#fnx23">[23]</a>
we have been pursuing an investigative path in this new
science with the pair &ldquo;man and bottlenose dolphin.&rdquo; We have
encouraged and pursued studies in classical sciences such as
neurophysiology, animal psychology, anatomy, biophysics, and
zoology. We have also initiated and pursued this new science
of the man and dolphin relation; these &ldquo;homo-delphic&rdquo; studies,
if you will, are triply demanding: we must not only know our
animal objectively but we must know man objectively, and ourselves
subjectively. We cannot fight shy of involving ourselves
in the investigation as objects also. In this science man, and
hence one&rsquo;s own self, are part of the system under investigation.
This is not an easy discipline. One must guard quite as rigorously
(or even more so) against the pitfalls of wishful thinking
and sensational fantasy as in other scientific endeavors. This field
requires a self-candor, an inner honesty, and a humility quite
difficult to acquire. But I maintain that good science can be done
here, that the field is a proper one for properly trained and properly
motivated investigators.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
